# CSV-to-SQL

**CSV-to-SQL** is a simple python script with a couple of helpers that will create a sqlite database, just as example to any other database, and it will a csv file to a list of dictionaries and then insert them into a table.

## Getting started

To test the example, clone the repository and run

```console
foo@bar:~$ python csv-to-sql.py 
```


## Use cases

- **For different databases**, the connection just needs to be replaced for a connection string with the database configuration.

- **For different data**, new sources of data just need to be provided into the data folder or the path FILE_PATH can be changed.
